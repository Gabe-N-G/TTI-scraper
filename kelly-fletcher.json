  "bio": "Coming to therapy for the first time can be difficult. You have already taken a huge leap by reaching out for help. As a therapist, my job is to provide and facilitate a space where they can listen and learn from themselves. A space that is non-judgemental and authentic, where healing can take place. I am always inspired by my clientâ€™s ability to make connections about how their adult self is influenced by their past. Making these connections is what breaks patterns and creates change.",
